This app was built fairly quickly over the course of a day, and as such, I didn't have as much time to polish, refactor, test, and otherwise make the code better. For your enjoyment, here is a list of things that I would like get to if I had more time:
 * Better handling of API Errors, preferably with custom Error classes
 * More tests. Way more tests.
 * More formalized approach to asyncronous processing during/after a request
 * Fetching of ERC-20 token balances
